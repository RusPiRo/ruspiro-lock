//! # Spinlock
//! Providing simple atomic Spinlock. This can be used to ensure cross core atomic access to data that is typically
//! shared between them. For example MMIO mapped registers that allow access to peripherals. Please note that usage
//! of Spinlocks on Raspberry Pi is only safe if the MMU has ben configured properly. Otherwise the cores trying to aquire
//! a lock will just hang, even if the lock would be available to them.
//!
//! # Example
//! ```
//! use ruspiro_lock::Spinlock;
//!
//! static LOCK: Spinlock = Spinlock::new();
//!
//! fn main () {
//!     LOCK.aquire(); // will only return if the lock could be set
//!     // do something
//!
//!     LOCK.release(); // releasing the lock
//! }
//! ```

/// to continue processing this lock should be held as short as possible. Also care shall be taken
/// while using this lock within interrupt handlers, as this might lead to deadlock situations if the
