//! # Spinlock
//! Providing simple atomic Spinlock. This can be used to ensure cross core atomic access to data that is typically
//! shared between them. For example MMIO mapped registers that allow access to peripherals. Please note that usage
//! of Spinlocks on Raspberry Pi is only safe if the MMU has ben configured properly. Otherwise the cores trying to aquire
//! a lock will just hang, even if the lock would be available to them.
//! 
//! # Example
//! ```
//! use ruspiro_lock::Spinlock;
//! 
//! static LOCK: Spinlock = Spinlock::new();
//! 
//! fn main () {
//!     LOCK.aquire(); // will only return if the lock could be set
//!     // do something
//! 
//!     LOCK.release(); // releasing the lock
//! }
//! ```
